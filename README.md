# Decaf-Compiler
A compiler written in Python that takes a subset of Java as input (dubbed Decaf, which uses the .decaf extension) and converts it to Abstract Machine Instructions (which uses the .ami extension). The PLY Python lexer/parser is included with it's copyright as this compiler relies on PLY heavily. The file structure will reveal that this was a University project.
